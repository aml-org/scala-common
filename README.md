The Scala Common project provides a Pure Scala common implementation that is platform-independent and has no dependencies on external libraries.

This project includes common utility code for:
- Core
  
  Provides basic utility methods to extend String and Char

- Ext

  Provides diff capabilities
  
- Io

  - Provides a common file system abstraction that is similar to `java.util.File` but includes implementations in JavaScript and JVM
  - Allows synchronous and asynchronous operations on both platforms

- Time

  Provides a simple platform-independent container for `DateTime` elements and includes platform-specific extensions


## In Development

- JVM API and libraries
- JavaScript API and libraries
- Improve documentation
